This challenge is a direct copy of something from PicoCTF where you look around the entire website to find parts of a flag. Flag parts can typically be found in html, css, and js files. It's a slighly spicier version of a view source code challenge.

There are 5 parts of the flag:

- Part 1: `[RS{/\/eveRG0nna_`, found in stylesheet
- Part 2: `TuRna30unD_`, found in `1.html`
- Part 3: `|3tY0|_|d0vvn_`, css on `dont.html`

etc etc
